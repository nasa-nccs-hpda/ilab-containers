# Container Repository Overview

This repository hosts all container recipe files (refactored from application-specific repositories) 
built by the Innovation Lab (IL) development team.  Primarly, two types of containers exist:  
1) General-purpose, and 2) Application-specific.  General-puropse containers contain reusable 
functionality for multiple applications.  Application-specific containers host unique software 
and configuration artifacts for a specific use.  Typically, they incorporate and extend the 
core general-purpose containers.
